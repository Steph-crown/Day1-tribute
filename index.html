			<p class="heading">About Alan Turing</p>
			<p class="text">Alan Turing was a brilliant British mathematician who took a leading role in breaking Nazi ciphers during WWII. In his seminal 1936 paper, 
				he proved that there cannot exist any universal algorithmic method of determining truth in mathematics, and that mathematics will always contain
				 undecidable propositions. His work is widely acknowledged as foundational research of computer science and artificial intelligence. <br>
				 During World War II, Turing was a leading participant in wartime code-breaking, particularly that of German ciphers. He worked at Bletchley
				  Park, the GCCS wartime station, where he made five major advances in the field of cryptanalysis, including specifying the bombe, an electromechanical
				   device used to help decipher German Enigma encrypted signals.<br>
				 Turing’s contributions to the code-breaking process didn’t stop there: He also wrote two papers about mathematical approaches to code-breaking, which 
				 became such important assets to the Code and Cypher School (later known as the Government Communications Headquarters) that the GCHQ waited until April 2012 
				 to release them to the National Archives of the United Kingdom.<br>

					Shortly after World War II, Alan Turing was awarded an Order of the British Empire for his work. For what would have been his 86th birthday, Turing biographer Andrew Hodges unveiled an official English Heritage blue plaque at his childhood home.

					In June 2007, a life-size statue of Turing was unveiled at Bletchley Park, in Buckinghamshire, England. A bronze statue of Turing was unveiled at the University of Surrey on October 28, 2004, to mark the 50th anniversary of his death.
